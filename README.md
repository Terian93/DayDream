# About
Angular 5 project (WIP)

# Note 
  -This project is using free subscription of firebase (\w angularfire2) and openweather API, so it's capabilities is limited:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing/">Firebase subscriptions</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://openweathermap.org/price">Openweather subscriptions</a></li>
  </ul>
  -All functions runing on client side, so sometimes it may look not so presentative 
  <br>(I will try to transfer most of the functions to server side \w firebase)

# Future updates
  -Backend on firebase functions
  <br>-Firebase and Openweather calls optimization
  <br>-User system with personal cities lists
